def fastdtw(x, y, radius=1, dist=None):
    ''' return the approximate distance between 2 time series with O(N)
        time and memory complexity

        Parameters
        ----------
        x : array_like
            input array 1
        y : array_like
            input array 2
        radius : int
            size of neighborhood when expanding the path. A higher value will
            increase the accuracy of the calculation but also increase time
            and memory consumption. A radius equal to the size of x and y will
            yield an exact dynamic time warping calculation.
        dist : function or int
            The method for calculating the distance between x[i] and y[j]. If
            dist is an int of value p > 0, then the p-norm will be used. If
            dist is a function then dist(x[i], y[j]) will be used. If dist is
            None then abs(x[i] - y[j]) will be used.

        Returns
        -------
        float
            the approximate distance between the 2 time series

        Examples
        --------
