    "The number of segments to capture is specified by `scope.adc.segments`. There are two ways that segmented captures are intended to be used:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The start of each segment comes from a trigger event. This is done by setting `scope.adc.segment_cycle_counter_en = False`. This can be used to drastically speed up captures, especially for captures that are not very long, because it allows a single arm + capture to record multiple traces, instead of doing an arm + capture for each individual trace. The target firmware must be modified to accomodate this.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The start of each segment is kicked off periodically every `scope.adc.segment_cycles` cycles. This is done by setting `scope.adc.segment_cycle_counter_en = True`. This can be useful for very long target operations that are composed of periodic, constant-time sub-operations. Public-key operations where each secret bit is processed in constant time are an example of this. The [CW305 ECC](CW305_ECC/CW305_ECC_part1.ipynb) series of demos shows an actual real-life example of this. In these cases, the advantages of using segments are that (1) your traces will require less storage, and (2) you can avoid streaming and its sampling rate limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is one non-obvious gotcha when using segments: the total capture size (i.e. `scope.adc.segments * scope.adc.samples`) cannot exceed 98352 samples, which is less than the maximum capture size when segmenting is not in use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond this, be aware that it's quite possible to set up `scope.adc` settings which result in some `scope.adc.errors`. Usually, the error would be \"segmenting error\", and most illegal scenarios have to do with segments being \"too close\" to each other. It's hard to precisely define \"too close\" because it depends on several settings. If you run into this error, either (a) you've mis-specified your segment settings, or (b) your segments are too close together, so either push them further apart, or realize that it's not worth using segments for your use-case."
