In the case of a simple password check, this allowed us to see how many characters of the password we had correct, eventually resulting in the password being broken.*\n",

For this purpose, the target is currently running AES, and it encrypted the text we sent it. If we're correct in our assumption, we should see a measurable difference between power traces with a high Hamming weight and a low one.\n",
