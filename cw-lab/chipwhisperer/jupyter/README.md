# ChipWhisperer Jupyter Notebook Repository

Welcome to the ultimate collection of ChipWhisperer Jupyter notebooks.

## Repo Contents

This repository serves multiple purposes:

* Courses (see `courses`) in Side-Channel Analysis (SCA) along with Fault Injection. These are organized to align with commercial course content on [ChipWhisperer.io](https://www.ChipWhisperer.io), but many are stand-alone and can serve as a self-taught course.

   * Course notebooks are open-source and you can follow along at your own pace too!
   
   * See [ChipWhisperer.io](https://www.ChipWhisperer.io) for more details.

* Experiments (see `experiments`) showcasing various things you can do with the ChipWhisperer platform. These notebooks may have less background, often require certain hardware to perform the experiments, and may be in a work in progress state.

* Demos (see `demos`) of various features and targets, such as ChipWhisperer-Pro streaming mode being used to capture long power traces, or hardware AES running on the CW305 FPGA board.

* Many notebooks have been overhauled and renamed - if you're looking for the previous version, see the `archive` directory (preserved here to keep links less broken on the internet).
