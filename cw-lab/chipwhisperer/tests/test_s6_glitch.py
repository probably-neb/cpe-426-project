""" 
USAGE:
    CW-Husky is used to measure and validate the glitch output from a
    Spartan6-based CW (i.e. Lite or Pro). Connect Husky HS1 to target CW's
    HS2 and vice-versa (and ground).
    Husky generates a 10 MHz clock, which the target CW uses as its glitch
    source clock. The target CW drives its glitch clock output on HS2. Husky
    samples both these clocks (at 500 MS/s) and checks that the glitch clock
    offset and width are within acceptable margins. The glitch output runs
    continously as there is no mechanism to synchronize the capture with a
    discrete glitch event in this setup.
    Args:
        target: Lite (default) or Pro 
        reps: number of times to run each test (default: 1)
        loose: loosen the test margins (default: False)
