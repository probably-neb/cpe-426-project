From https://github.com/kmackay/micro-ecc/commit/601bd11062c551b108adbb43ba99f199b840777c

There are subsequent commits to micro-ecc which address side-channel leakage, but these should not impact the micro-ecc attack tutorial.

Added trigger_high() and trigger_low() to uECC.c, but they are #ifdef'd out by default.
