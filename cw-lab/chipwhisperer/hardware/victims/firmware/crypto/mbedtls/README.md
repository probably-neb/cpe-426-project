README for mbed TLS
===================

This directory contains a copy of mbed TLS 2.5.1. This may be updated in time.

You can get the latest version of mbed TLS at https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbedtls .

This directory only includes the "library" and "include" folders, but none of the files have been modified from the "virgin" build status. As much as possible all configuration is done through Makefile.mbedtls in the parent directory.
