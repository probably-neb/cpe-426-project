# ChipWhisperer-Nano

ChipWhisperer-Nano is a super-low cost SCA platform (with even some glitching support). See the [full datasheet](https://github.com/newaetech/chipwhisperer/blob/develop/hardware/capture/chipwhisperer-nano/NAE-CW1101_datasheet.pdf "full datasheet") for a more detailed overview of capabilities.

You can check out the [Tutorials](https://chipwhisperer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials.html) - note many of them work on the CWNANO (but not all). This lets you do attacks like password checks, AES, etc.

ChipWhisperer-Nano is available from [https://www.mouser.com/Search/Refine?Keyword=CWNANO](https://www.mouser.com/Search/Refine?Keyword=CWNANO "Mouser") .
